## Progress report to Manni
We have 2 workflow to test, Flake1.yml and Flake2.yml.

The server/GHA code in app.js is running. 
    - It is stuck on "‚ùå Error! Status: 404. Message: Not Found" (row 89)

Workflows have not yet been able to test call

On My confluence page there is a page "GitHub FossId" that describes what the demo concluded.
    Short Summary:
We do now try to have a central repository including a workflow. A GitHub App to call the WF and send inputs on PR.opened.
The WF is supposed to run FossId (Flake8 as test), and feed back the result as a comment to the repository making a pull request.

## Further steps
The enterprise trail is up. So a new account needs to be created on github to test on.
